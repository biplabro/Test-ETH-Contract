# Lottery contract

This contract uses the following usecase.

A manager deploys the contract > players participate with a minimum entry fee > winner is selected using a random function based on difficulty level, time & number of players `return uint (keccak256(block.difficulty, now, players));` > send the lottery funds to the winner address > reset the players array.
